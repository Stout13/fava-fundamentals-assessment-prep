## Problems



[//]: # (1a. Make a class called review and create a public static method that takes in a double 
called radius, so that you can find the circumference of a circle. &#40;Circumference Equation: 
C = 2Ï€r&#41;)



[//]: # (1b. make the circumference method work with integers and doubles by using method 
overloading)

[//]: # (2. Create a public static method called `total` with two `double` parameters named 
'bill' and 'tipPercentage'.)

[//]: # (    - Return the final bill &#40;`double`&#41;, including tip. &#40;Equation: 
bill + &#40;&#40;tipPercentage / 100&#41; * bill&#41; = total&#41;)

[//]: # (3. Create a public static method called `even` which takes in an int[] 
and souts out the even numbers)

[//]: # (4. Create a package called **carShop**. Inside **carShop** create a 
new class called **Car**. Make instance fields that can't be accessed outside **Car**.)

[//]: # (   These fields should be of type `String` named `model`, `make`, `color`, 
and an `int` named `year`. Create a constructor that sets the `model`, `make`, `color`, and `year`. Write 
getters and setters for each property.&#40;Remember we can generate these by right clicking -> 'Generate' -> 
Getters and Setters&#41;)


[//]: # (5. Inside **carShop** create another class called **Customer** and make 
instance fields that can't be accessed outside **Customer**,)

[//]: # (   these fields should be string called `firstName` and `lastName`. 
Create a constructor that sets)

[//]: # (   `firstName` and `lastName`. Write getters and setters for each property.)


[//]: # (6. Create an interface named **Describable**)

[//]: # (   -Specify an instance method named `describe` that accepts a String 'details' 
parameters and returns a string)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (   -Make your *Customer* class implement the *Describable* interface)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (   -The implementation of the `describe` method on the Customer class should 
return something like the following message:)
      ```
      Hey there firstName lastName, it looks like your color, year, make, model is ready to go!`
      ```

[//]: # (7. Create a **DealershipApp** class, which will contain your main method. 
**This** is where you test the following, not in **Review**)

[//]: # (   -in main&#40;&#41;, you will make new Customer and Car objects, then sout out the 
return of Customer's describe&#40;&#41; implementation.)
